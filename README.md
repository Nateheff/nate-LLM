NATE is a transformer-based decoder-only LLM. There is also NateClass which is similar to NATE but has an extra fully connected layer at the end making the model
more of a text-classification model than a generational model. NateClass is used in the project [SAM](https://github.com/Nateheff/SAM) as the orchestrator, telling the system whether the gun should track, fire,
or do nothing.
