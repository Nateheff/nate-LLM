NATE is a transformer-based decoder-only LLM. There is also NateClass which is similar to NATE, but has an extra fully connected layer at the end making the model
into more of a text-classification model than generational model. NateClass is used in the project SAM as the orchestrator, telling the system wether the gun should track, fire,
or do nothing.
